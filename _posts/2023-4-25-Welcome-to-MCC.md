 This is a website dedicated to documenting the development of minimal computing and inviting scholars, teachers, and students in academia and secondary education to try applying minimal computing to their own work. If you're interested in exploring existing minimal computing writing and tools, check out [RESOURCES](https://mincompcookbook.github.io/resources/). If you want to know more about how to get started and ways you could explore minimal computing in your own work, take a look at the [GUIDES](https://mincompcookbook.github.io/guides/). If you want to know more about this project or contact the Cookbook, go to the [ABOUT](https://mincompcookbook.github.io/about/) page.
