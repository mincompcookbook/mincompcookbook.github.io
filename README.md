# Welcome to the Back End of the MinComp Cookbook!

## How to Use This Repository
The MinComp Cookbook is built on a Jekyll template: a set of code files that generate a static website (for more information on what a static site is and static vs. dynamic sites, [Wikipedia's article on static sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) is a useful starting point). The Jekyll template used is Jekyll Now, by Barry Clark(link to the repository for Jekyll Now).  
Page content is contained in Markdown files (ending with the file extension .md), which are mostly listed at the end of the filed directory above. The visual attributes of the site like font and color are controlled by the "style.scss" file (colors are defined in the "_variables.scss" file). Page layouts for different kinds of pages on the site are created by the files in the "layouts" folder. This is not an exhaustive description of the moving parts of the site, but these are the things I have changed the most from the original website template.

## Why the CookBook is on GitHub
There are many options for building and hosting a web content, from social media to hosting services like Squarespace and WordPress to writing the code for the site yourself. 
In the interest of following minimal computing principles, I chose GitHub Pages and used an existing website template. This created a nice balance between speedy, beginner-friendly setup and increased agency over website content/structure. It also features the option of exploring more back end adjustments as time permitted.
