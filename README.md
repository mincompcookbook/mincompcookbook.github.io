# Welcome to the Back End of the MinComp Cookbook!

## How to Use This Repository
The MinComp Cookbook is built on a Jekyll template: a set of code files that generate a static website (for more information on what a static site is and static vs. dynamic sites, click here). The Jekyll template is Jekyll Now, by Barry Clark(link to the repository for Jekyll Now).

## Why the CookBook is on GitHub
There are many options for building and hosting a web content, from social media to hosting services like Squarespace and WordPress to writing the code for the site yourself. 
In the interest of following minimal computing principles, I chose GitHub Pages and used an existing website template. This created a nice balance between support and premade website options for time and ease, and having some understanding of the wokring of the site.
